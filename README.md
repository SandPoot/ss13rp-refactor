# ss13rp-refactor

Rich Presence for the game Space Station 13!

This is a rework to qwerty's rich presence, should work with most
codebases without having it on a config file, still should do some
management ui as they wanted it, just got to figure it out.

IF YOU HAD EITHER HIS OR MY VERSION BEFORE THIS, DELETE IT IN
`C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`
THEY MIGHT CONFLICT WITH EACH OTHER.

## Compiling for testing

Requirements:
Python 3.6+?
and doing all those:

```py
get-pip.py
pip install pypresence
pip install wheel
pip install pywin32
pip install psutil
pip install requests
```

Afterwards you can just run main.py

## Installation

Download the installer [here](https://github.com/qwertyquerty/ss13rp/raw/master/dist/install.exe) and run it. If you don't trust me, because no one seems to, compile it yourself. You could use something like pyinstaller.
